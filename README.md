## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

* `git clone git@github.com:avaldigitallabs/devops-pipeline-assets-example.git` this repository
* change into the new directory `cd ddevops-pipeline-assets-example`

## Git Crypt
If you need to save secrets in your assets-project


### Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

<ul> 
<li>[git](http://git-scm.com/)</li>
<li> [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt)</li>
<li> [GPG](https://gnupg.org/)</li>
</ul>




### For all collaborators

Every collaborators needs to generate their own GPG key pairs & then needs to be shipped to any user who already have the authority to add users to and encrypted repo, for example; **Your team Architect!**
<ol>
<li>

#### Install git-crypt with Homebrew

```bash
brew install git-crypt
```
</li>

<li>

#### Install GPG with Homebrew

```bash
brew install gpg
```
</li>

<li>

#### Generating your GPG key

The first step to use GnuPG is to create the `Public` and `Private` key pairs.

The following command is used to create the keys:

```bash
gpg --gen-key
```

This will prompt you for your `Name`, `Email` and `Pass-phrase`:

- **Name:** Please use your full name, i.e. *Covid Pepito Perez Rodriguez*
- **Email:** Will uniquely identify you. Please use your *ADL* email. e.g. *covid.perez@avaldigitallabs.com*
- **Pass-phrase:** Make sure you enter a strong one. You again need to confirm the pass-phrase

After generating the keys, you can get information about it use `list-keys` command:

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

You will get output something like this:

```console
$ gpg --list-keys

/Users/covid.perez/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
----------------------------------
pub   rsa2048 2020-07-29 [SC] [expires: 2022-07-29]
      B44DABCCD78435E7F4E9676416DC869402E26669
uid           [ultimate] Covid Pepito Perez Rodriguez <covid.perez@avaldigitallabs.com>
sub   rsa2048 2020-07-29 [E] [expires: 2022-07-29]
```

You need to get the `Public` key which is a hexadecimal string in the previous command. In this case it is :point_right: `B44DABCCD78435E7F4E9676416DC869402E26669`.
</li>

<li>

#### Exporting your GPG key

Next step is to export your `Public` key to a GPG file. Using the `export` command:

```bash
gpg --armor --export --output covid_perez.gpg B44DABCCD78435E7F4E9676416DC869402E26669
```

This step will generate a GPG file called name `covid_perez.gpg` in the current directory. This GPG file looks like this:

```console
$ cat covid_perez.gpg

-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

After this final step, are you ready to share your collaborator `Public` GPG file with your team Architect!


</li>

</ol>

<li>    

### For team Architects

<ol>
<li>First off all, you need to clone the new created repo, change to the src code repo and initialise `git-crypt`. This init step should be executed only one time in the entire repository life.
</li>
<li>Adding collaborators to an encrypted repo is easy, you need to import the collaborator's `Public` key in order to add the key to the "repo" `Keyring` then trust it and finally add the collaborator to the encrypted repo.
</li>
<li>Don't Forget to add the @devops-security-team (Hackers Team) and Jenkins CI/CD `Public` keys to the "repo" `Keyring` just as another repo collaborator.
</li>
<li>Finally, You can `git push` the repo and the new encryption will be pushed out.
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>

#### Initialising the repo

This will initialise `git-crypt` in the new repository, but *it does not encrypt any files by default*. `git_crypt` uses the `.gitattributes` file to define what files it will manage.

Naturally, you want to do this before you create the sensitive files.

```console
$ git clone git@github.avaldigitallabs.com:avaldigitallabs/devops-pipeline-params-pre-example.git

Cloning into 'devops-pipeline-params-pre-example'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 120, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (120/120), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (84/84), done.
remote: Total 120 (delta 29), reused 103 (delta 23), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (120/120), 40.89 KiB | 307.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (29/29), done.

$ cd devops-pipeline-params-pre-example

$ git-crypt init

Generating key...
```

This will also generate `.git-crypt` folder in your root repo which will contain the public keys of collaborators.
</li>

<li>

#### Importing a collaborator Public key

For this use GPG `import` command:

```bash
gpg --import covid_perez.gpg
```

You will get output something like this (Please verify name and ADL email :pray:):

```console
$ gpg --import covid_perez.gpg

gpg: key 16DC869402E26669: public key "Covid Pepito Perez Rodriguez <covid.perez@avaldigitallabs.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

After importing the collaborator `Public` key, you can get information about all available keys with `list-keys` command:

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

You will get output something like this (look the `unknown` trusted level :sweat: down bellow):

```console
$ gpg --list-keys

/Users/covid.perez/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
----------------------------------
pub   rsa2048 2020-07-29 [SC] [expires: 2022-07-29]

sub   rsa2048 2020-07-29 [E] [expires: 2022-07-29]
```
</li>

<li>

#### Trusting a collaborator imported Public key

Next step is to add trust to the collaborator `Public` key with `editâ€“key` command:

This will lead to a GPG prompt where you can get the fingerprint of the collaborator `Public` key by using `fpr` command:

Add trust level to collaborator by `trust` command. It will ask for a trust level to select, add accordingly.

```console
$ gpg --edit-key B44DABCCD78435E7F4E9676416DC869402E26669

After verifying the fingerprint save & quit changes by `save` command:

```console
gpg> save
```

Quit the prompt by `quit` command:

```console
gpg> quit
```
</li>
<li>

#### Adding a collaborator to the encrypted repo

Now you have added and trusted the collaborator's `Public` key to your `Keyring`, all thatâ€™s left to do is add that `Public` key to the repo. You can do that with the `add-gpg-user` command. This will not only add the collaboratorâ€™s `Public` key as a verified decrypted but also serves as a git commit.

```console
$ git-crypt add-gpg-user B44DABCCD78435E7F4E9676416DC869402E26669

$ git log --oneline -n 1

23963ed (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Add 1 git-crypt collaborator
```
</li>
<li>

#### Adding Hackers Team & Jenkins CICD to the encrypted repo

Add the @devops-security-team (Hackers Team) and Jenkins CI/CD `Public` keys to the "repo" `Keyring`  as another repo collaborator. This process is exactly the same previous steps using the GPG files located in the `keys` folder.

```console
$ tree -L 3

    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ payments.yml

8 directories, 20 files
```

For example, after importing and trust the Jenkins CI/CD GPG file, You will probably execute:

```bash
git-crypt add-gpg-user DAD1E51F1209751FD2F1BB4C9C848B9BB871610E
```
</li>
<li>

#### Pushing your repo setup

At this point, you can `git push` your feature branch, create a PR to `master` branch, and the new encryption will be pushed out after merge the PR :muscle:.
</li>

<li>

### So, the repo is ready, now What?

For all collaborators, after cloning the repo, all files mentioned in the `.gitattributes` file will be encrypted. You can unlock files by `unlock` command:

```bash
git-crypt unlock
```

You should only execute this `unlock` step after clone the repo, then all files will be encrypted before `push` and decrypted after `pull` from the repo.

What? From now on the files will be automatically encrypted on every `push`, i.e. you will be able to read and edit them in your local working copy, but on the remote and in other working copies the files will be encrypted.

`git-crypt` gracefully degrades, so developers without the secret key can still clone and commit to a repository with encrypted files.

**Summary:** After unlock the repo, you can use it as any other repo :wink:

>:cop: WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND PLAY WITH THIS ENCRYPTED REPO IN CONSOLE/TERMINAL WAY. :cop:
>
> *This lets you store your secret material (such as keys or passwords) in the same repository as your code, without requiring you to lock down your entire repository.*
>
>:rotating_light: Be carefull if you are using a Git UI or Git "fancy" client :rotating_light:
</li>

## Use of Generic files

In order to make use of the Generic Files feature you just have to create the folders `ios` and `android` in the root
of the project and save your generic files there.

Have in mind that files in said folders, go to a different s3 target in the operations account
in their respective bucket `ios-files-bkt` or `android-files-bkt`.



### git-crypt with generic files

Inside the folders `ios` and `android` you can create a  sub-folder `secrets` but first add the directories

    ios/secrets/** filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
    android/secrets/** filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
in the file `.gitatributes` when you finish your git-crypt [configuration](#Git Crypt).
